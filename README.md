## Hi there üëã
I'm Cooper Sizemore, a motivated **computer science** student graduating from **NC State** in May 2027! I'm passionate about solving complex, real problems using software and providing useful and valuable software solutions to people. To me, software is about **people**, as it gives us a chance to solve problems for all kinds of people at a massive scale, and that notion is what drives me as a software engineer.

## Projects! üë®‚Äçüíª

Check out [Interview Arcade](https://github.com/coopersizemore/InterviewArcade), my HackNC 2025 **1st Place winning** Hackathon Project where my team and I built a mock technical interview tool powered by AI in 24 hours!

At my **first Hackathon**, HackNC_State 2025, my team and I built [Kindred](https://github.com/simong2/kindred), a cross-platform mobile app for homeless organizations and food kitchens to post requests for goods that the community can fulfuill! 

To see my work from App Development Club, check out [CoursePilot](https://github.com/NCSU-App-Development-Club/coursepilot), a tool for NCSU students to build prospective schedules from the convenience of their mobile phone!

A personal project in the early stages of development that I'm working on is [PlayLS](https://github.com/coopersizemore/playls), an application that will help keep Spotify playlists fresh by cycling songs in and out on a fixed interval!
